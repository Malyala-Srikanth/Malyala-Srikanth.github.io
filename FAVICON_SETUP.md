# Favicon Setup Guide

## âœ… Quick Fix Applied

I've temporarily fixed the 404 error by:
1. âœ… Created `_includes/favicons.html` include file
2. âœ… Created `assets/img/favicons/` directory  
3. âœ… Added basic `favicon.ico` in root directory

The error should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŽ¨ Next Steps: Add Your Custom Favicon

To replace the placeholder with your own favicon:

### Step 1: Create Your Favicon Image
- Start with a **square image** (PNG, JPG, or SVG)
- Minimum size: **512x512 pixels**
- Use your logo, initials, or any image that represents your site

### Step 2: Generate Favicon Files
1. Go to **[Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)**
2. Click "Select your Favicon image" and upload your image
3. Keep the default settings and click "Generate your Favicons and HTML code"
4. Download the generated package

### Step 3: Install the Favicon Files
1. **Extract** the downloaded ZIP file
2. **Delete** these files from the extracted folder:
   - `browserconfig.xml`
   - `site.webmanifest`
3. **Copy** the remaining files (`.PNG` and `.ICO` files) to `assets/img/favicons/`

### Step 4: Test Your Favicon
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add custom favicon"
git push origin main
```

Your custom favicon will appear in browser tabs after GitHub Pages rebuilds your site (usually within a few minutes).

## ðŸ”§ Current File Structure

```
your-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico                     # âœ… Root fallback (temporary)
â”œâ”€â”€ _includes/favicons.html         # âœ… Theme include file  
â””â”€â”€ assets/img/favicons/            # âœ… Ready for your files
    â”œâ”€â”€ apple-touch-icon.png        # (add your files here)
    â”œâ”€â”€ favicon-32x32.png           # (add your files here)
    â”œâ”€â”€ favicon-16x16.png           # (add your files here)
    â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico                 # (add your files here)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Option: Use Text-Based Favicon

If you want something simple right now, you can create a text-based favicon using online tools:
- Search for "text to favicon generator"
- Enter your initials (e.g., "MS" for Malyala Srikanth)
- Download and follow Step 3 above
