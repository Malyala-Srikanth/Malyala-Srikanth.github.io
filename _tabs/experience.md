# Experience

## Applied Data Scientist II, Future AGI (Nov 2024 — Present)
Bengaluru, Karnataka
- Led the research and development of the futureagi SDK enabling seamless developer communication with platform features, and contributed to comprehensive SDK documentation.
- Developed an MCP server from scratch named futureagi-mcp-server to interact with futureagi functionalities using natural language.
- Built Django APIs with designers and frontend teams for seamless integration and meeting product requirements.
- Researched on LLM as a Judge and set up a benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the LLM as a Judge based evaluation agents using ground truth data.

## Data Scientist II, VMock India Pvt Ltd (Apr 2023 — Oct 2024)
Gurgaon, Haryana
- Finetuned LayoutLMForTokenClassification language model using transformers library to extract named entities in experience section which uses both text and spatial information from resume obtaining overall f1 score of 0.844.
- Researched on efficient single GPU training methodologies using PyTorch and presented it to the entire team of 12 data scientists, useful for faster and cost-effective finetuning of LLM’s.
- Extracted bullets with weak action verbs from resume and leveraged semantic search using multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 contextual embeddings to suggest relevant strong action verbs with the help of OpenSearch (search engine).
- Built a scalable event-driven service using AWS SNS and GPT-4o (LLM) to extract and structure information from image PDFs, providing feedback using prompt engineering.

## Data Scientist I, VMock India Pvt Ltd (Dec 2020 — Mar 2023)
Gurgaon, Haryana
- Researched and implemented ASPOSE, a third-party .NET-based tool, to provide support for DOCX Format for parsing resumes uploaded by students across 260+ universities and 10000+ benchmarks.
- Retrained Partially Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) to predict resume super-sections based on n-grams, improving top-1 accuracy from 81.9% to 89.6% and top-2 accuracy from 92.2% to 96.7% through k-fold cross-validation.
- Finetuned bert-base-cased large language model for merging bullets written in multiple lines (NSP), utilizing DVC for efficient data tracking and MlFlow for metrics tracking and obtained an accuracy of around 93%.
- Implemented recommendation algorithm that suggests similar jobs and candidates based on users past interactions, enhancing the overall user experience using node2vec in NEO4J and obtained NDCG of 0.76.
