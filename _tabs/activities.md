                <p>I ‚ù§ Football. I engage in playing Football two times per week. I am an avid follower of the Premier League, La Liga, and Bundesliga. Although it may seem unusual, my preferred team is Tottenham Hotspur. Among the players, Son Heung-Min holds a special place as my favorite. Additionally, I greatly enjoy observing the performances of Borussia Dortmund, with Marco Reus often delivering captivating displays on the field.</p>
